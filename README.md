Open Runtime
============

***WE HAVE MOVED TO GITLAB <https://gitlab.com/alexbuzzbee/Open-Runtime>***

Open Runtime is an open source bytecode-based runtime environment intended to allow portable development in many programming languages. This repository contains specification documents for Open Runtime and source code for OR++, the C++ reference implementation of Open Runtime; ORASM, the Open Runtime Bytecode Assembler; and ORBASIC, the Open Runtime BASIC Compiler (or at least it will, once such source code exists).
